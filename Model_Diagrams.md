**Next Steps**
- Discuss the results with fire experts from Forest Fire Services of NRCan for their inputs.
    - Better understanding of importance of precision and recall
- Incorporate some features that link to the civil structures such as distance to the nearby towns and road.
- Try incorporate macro climate variability variables such as Southern Oscillation Index, & El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation.
- Expand dataset to include 2020 to 2022 wildfires
- Incorporate LSTM into the ensemble model
- Explore preprocessing filter steps to handle outliers (locations that models consistently have troubles predicting)
