In addition, the model's predictive accuracy may be impacted by limitations in the spatial and temporal resolution of climate data. It is imperative to openly acknowledge these limitations and include uncertainty estimates in model outputs to effectively manage expectations.\n","\n","* Recommendations for Use: It is important to provide users with comprehensive documentation that clarifies the model's assumptions, limitations and uncertainties in order to ensure effective and ethical utilization. It is essential to communicate recommendations for interpreting model predictions and understanding confidence levels. Additionally, providing guidelines for incorporating additional contextual information when making decisions based on model outputs is required. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the model's performance, in addition to periodic revisions and modifications are required to maintain its ongoing effectiveness and ethical implementation. In addition, establishing user training and awareness programs may promote responsible and informed utilization of the model by all stakeholders.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Cpjj_odKu2g8"},"source":["# Additional Information\n","* Contact Information: caitken@ualberta.ca\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3tb7KShnvGzz"},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1oSu2rG-xlEz1xDLNjZJeX4nNL0diuJuU","timestamp":1713570306465}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
